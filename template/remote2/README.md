# Remote module for micro-frontend

This is the `remote2` module, to be consumed in a Module Federation setup.

This project is built using `Vite` and `@originjs/vite-plugin-federation`. The TS setup is orchestrated with `vite-tsconfig-paths`.

## TODOs

- Expose the module types to the consumers. Currently TS complains.
