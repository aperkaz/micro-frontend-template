# micro-frontend-template ðŸŸ¢ðŸ”¦

Technical foundation to build, deploy, compose and manage distributed frontend apps with module federation.

## Features

The following areas will be addressed (but not limited to), either within the template or as supportive tooling:

- Communication: between micro-frontends and the host app. Not all micro-frontends may use module-federation.
- Runtime error management: tracing, observabilty, isolating crashes...
- Developer experience: typescript support, proxying between environments... how to keep a good DX. 
- Service discovery: runtime discovery of available services to compose
- Versioning: how to automatically version new releases and keep track of the deployed service graph (could be a tool).
- Deployments: micro-frontend deployments, health checks, source-maps, iframing legacy apps, preferred process and needed environments...
- Performance: bundle-sizes, and other relevant metrics (e.g. TTI).
- Testing: e2e, contract, unit... in a distributed context.
- CI pipelines: encourage non-breaking APIs and best practices in a distributed environment. May not be applicable, but worth looking into it nonetheless.
